                <p>Hi My name is Kayla, I've spent the past 10 years of my career working in the medical field and one day I decided I
                    wanted a change. Now here I am  currently taking a 6 month bootcamp and loving it! I have worked with Vanilla JS, Node.js, Express.js,
                    TDD, Databases and now React. I hope you browse through my portfolio and feel free to contact me with any questions/constructive criticism.</p>
